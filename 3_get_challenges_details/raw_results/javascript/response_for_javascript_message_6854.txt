The prince is coming to get the princess and you have to stop him. He's entering the castle on a horse, don't ask me why he's riding a horse... he just is!\\n\\nYou're standing next to the cannon and you have to check if the aim / velocity / height is ok for hitting the prince on his horse.\\n\\nYour function will get four values / circumstances:\\n\\n1. Velocity\\n2. Angle\\n3. Height\\n4. Distance to the prince\\n\\nWith the formula of **Ballistic Trajectory** you'll be able to calculate the distance the cannonball is gonna travel for impact. You don't need to apply rounding.\\n\\nThe complete formula is found in the **Resources** section. Computations are based on the acceleration of gravity on the earth's surface (9.81 m/s/s), atmospheric drag is neglected. The chance of hitting the prince / his horse is plus or minus 0.5m.\\n\\n### Examples\\n```\\nhitPrince(10, 10, 10, 16) ➞ true\\n\\nhitPrince(20, 45, 0, 45) ➞ false\\n\\nhitPrince(5, 45, 10, 6) ➞ true\\n```\\n\\n![Ballistic Trajectory](https://edabit-challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/trajectory-2D.gif)\\n\\n### Notes\\n- No actual princes / horses are harmed during the making of this challenge.\\n- All the inputs are correct. 0 > Angle < 90, and so on.\\n- Values will be in meters per second / degrees / meters.\",\"isFree\":false,\"isHidden\":false,\"lab\":\"[\\n  [[10,10,10,16], true],\\n  [[50,5,5,76], false],\\n  [[16,16,16,36], true],\\n  [[20,20,20,54], false],\\n  [[20,45,0,45], false],\\n  [[100,30,100,1031], true], // Good shot!\\n  [[50,5,50,182], false],\\n  [[10,10,10,17], false],\\n  [[5,45,10,6], true]\\n].forEach(x => Test.assertEquals(hitPrince(...x[0]), x[1]));\",\"language\":\"javascript\",\"stats\":{\"completed\":{\"ratings\":[4,4,4,4,4,3,3,5,3,3,2,4,2,1,3,3],\"rators\":[\"Akq3fQcPRgPrWfsye\",\"yjtdwc2AC4jA2RWtn\",\"Nb6LYPoQP6KJZt8mz\",\"mHT2bJb5SByfJ8yKS\",\"aEm3Wvj2rFYRL8Lrb\",\"Po3v3dHCk6wYGKMwi\",\"sdfo3WDPcuNc9hfbt\",\"86RhHD27rvvnBRRoc\",\"MsA397u6Nm5fL32H9\",\"J5MgLszeGgtciW56n\",\"NiKD9DwNz3RA3nvHF\"],\"total\":14,\"quality\":[]},\"flags\":0},\"summary\":\"You're working for Jaffar in the newest game of Prince of Persia.
