A hero is fighting various monsters, and you have to determine the battle's outcome for each engaged skirmish. Hero and monsters share some stats:\\n\\n- **HP** or _Health Points_: The amount of damage the character can sustain. If it reaches 0 (or less) the character dies.\\n- **ATT** or _Attack_: The character offensive capacity.\\n- **DEF** or _Defense_: The character defensive capacity.\\n\\nFor either hero and monster, the damage inflicted is calculated subtracting the opponent's defense score from the attacker doubled attack score.\\n\\nIn each round hero attacks first, and his damage rate is subtracted from the monster's HP. If the monster survives (HP > 0), it is his turn to attack. If the hero survives (HP > 0), a new round starts. The hero can also have some **POT**, or _Healing Potions_, in his backpack: only when his HP is equal to or lower than 10, a potion can (and must) be used for regaining 10 HP at the start of a new round. When the hero heals, he can't attack, but he receives only half damage from the monster's attack. Every potion can be used only once, then it must be discarded.\\n\\nGiven an object containing the character's stats (with _p_-prefix ones being the hero's stats and _m_-prefix ones being the monster's) you must return a string:\\n\\n- \\\"**Victory in _x_ rounds**\\\" if the hero wins.\\n- \\\"**Game Over in _x_ rounds**\\\" if the monster wins.\\n\\n(with _x_ being the number of rounds elapsed)\\n\\n### Examples\\n```\\nbattle({\\n  pHP: 12,\\n  pATT: 10,\\n  pDEF: 10,\\n  pPOT: 0,\\n  mHP: 20,\\n  mATT: 6,\\n  mDEF: 14\\n}) ➞ \\\"Victory in 4 rounds\\\"\\n\\n// Hero's damage rate = (10 * 2) - 14 = 6\\n// Monster's damage rate = (6 * 2) - 10 = 2\\n// Round 1: mHP - 6 = 14, pHP - 2 = 10\\n// Round 2: No potions to use! mHP - 6 = 8, pHP - 2 = 8\\n// Round 3: mHP - 6 = 2, pHP - 2 = 6\\n// Round 4: mHP - 6 = -4 ... monster is dead\\n\\nbattle({\\n  pHP: 10,\\n  pATT: 10,\\n  pDEF: 10,\\n  pPOT: 2,\\n  mHP: 10,\\n  mATT: 8,\\n  mDEF: 14\\n}) ➞ \\\"Victory in 3 rounds\\\"\\n\\n// Hero's damage = 6, monster's damage = 6\\n// Round 1: mHp - 6 = 4, pHP - 6 = 4\\n// Round 2: Player uses a potion, heals 10 HP, receive half the monster damage, pHP = 11\\n// Round 3: mHP - 6 = -2 ... monster is dead\\n\\nbattle({\\n  pHP: 12,\\n  pATT: 7,\\n  pDEF: 6,\\n  pPOT: 2,\\n  mHP: 30,\\n  mATT: 8,\\n  mDEF: 10\\n}) ➞ \\\"Game Over in 5 rounds\\\"\\n\\n// Hero's damage rate = 4, Monster's damage rate = 10\\n// Round 1: mHP - 4 = 26, pHP - 10 = 2\\n// Round 2: Hero heals 10 hp, monster hit for 5 HP, pHP = 7\\n// Round 3: Hero heals 10 hp, monster hit for 5 HP, pHP = 12\\n// Round 4: mHP - 4 = 22, pHP - 10 = 2\\n// Round 5: No potions to use! mHP - 4 = 18, pHP - 10 = -8 ... hero is dead\\n```\\n\\n### Notes\\n- Hero attacks (or heals) first in each round.\\n- A potion **must** be used when HP is equal to or less than 10.\\n- When the hero uses a potion, he can't attack the monster in the same round, but he can defend from the monster's attack, receiving only half the damage.\\n- Remember to discard the potion after using it.\",\"lab\":\"Test.assertEquals(battle({pHP: 10, pATT: 10, pDEF: 10, pPOT: 0, mHP: 20, mATT: 6, mDEF: 14}), \\\"Victory in 4 rounds\\\", \\\"Example #1\\\")\\nTest.assertEquals(battle({pHP: 10, pATT: 10, pDEF: 10, pPOT: 2, mHP: 10, mATT: 8, mDEF: 14}), \\\"Victory in 3 rounds\\\", \\\"Example #2\\\")\\nTest.assertEquals(battle({pHP: 12, pATT: 7, pDEF: 6, pPOT: 2, mHP: 30, mATT: 8, mDEF: 10}), \\\"Game Over in 5 rounds\\\", \\\"Example #3\\\")\\nTest.assertEquals(battle({pHP: 100, pATT: 12, pDEF: 8, pPOT: 3, mHP: 200, mATT: 14, mDEF: 8}), \\\"Game Over in 5 rounds\\\")\\nTest.assertEquals(battle({pHP: 300, pATT: 5, pDEF: 4, pPOT: 0, mHP: 120, mATT: 10, mDEF: 6}), \\\"Game Over in 19 rounds\\\")\\nTest.assertEquals(battle({pHP: 1480, pATT: 16, pDEF: 16, pPOT: 4, mHP: 860, mATT: 14, mDEF: 20}), \\\"Victory in 72 rounds\\\")\\nTest.assertEquals(battle({pHP: 230, pATT: 3, pDEF: 20, pPOT: 2, mHP: 140, mATT: 12, mDEF: 4}), \\\"Game Over in 64 rounds\\\")\\nTest.assertEquals(battle({pHP: 90, pATT: 9, pDEF: 10, pPOT: 8, mHP: 300, mATT: 8, mDEF: 4}), \\\"Victory in 29 rounds\\\")\",\"language\":\"javascript\",\"stats\":{\"completed\":{\"ratings\":[2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,0,2,2,1,3,2,3,2,3,4,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,3,3,3],\"rators\":[\"5Zq3aGdvh4LHBvnJL\",\"XKi8iZXBCHCaebSHh\",\"yjtdwc2AC4jA2RWtn\",\"7Nz3GAqN3SMgSiyTT\",\"EWn8w8P3nNh7knatY\",\"AasGs8AeX9Lcb9xJn\",\"65dbBZynphj53nXqA\",\"DHwbkbzYNpmkSFT7u\",\"FJsvM5yqKuK9yMk9P\",\"RxpG2HZPp3AXLogCZ\",\"n5wubRfh6zh8QRymN\",\"5HRPnrWvfDLAiEGFc\",\"HAabAnJK3NGHaTm7K\",\"PHG5L3JeydYmYP5b9\",\"Gx9obhqfXPqYuC6Jd\",\"6BpBQnSGhzgvhXrEy\",\"LgDic4cD77oG8XtwP\",\"ZonzvirRsxE8CSLHn\",\"pd8dm7sWLW9cY6dYW\",\"RE4Mm9T6Q9uygAxGS\",\"Yuq5N4Mtp6vCKccuD\",\"JGBCMpnbbi5ztuFoX\",\"mHT2bJb5SByfJ8yKS\",\"qWZ9QPopEKoWxWjjx\",\"aEm3Wvj2rFYRL8Lrb\",\"nphNJCcuiQKh8bNHq\",\"CNc6rmwhbxkxEhHAp\",\"tAF9Gf6PiGogbZuWs\",\"4NkKHMs5auWkyyPod\",\"YSmLyP3eRhcFjJPzg\"],\"total\":32,\"quality\":[5,3]},\"flags\":0},\"subscribers\":[\"5Zq3aGdvh4LHBvnJL\"],\"summary\":\"You are implementing a battle system for a simple role-playing game.
