When he returns to earth he finds that Jill has grown to adulthood while he, Jack, remains a young boy.\\n\\nAlbert Einstein had predicted this strange quirk of time in his 1905 paper \\\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\\\" aka The Theory of Special Relativity. It has been verified experimentally many times.\\n\\nImplement a function that has as its arguments: The twins' age at the time of Jack's departure, the distance in light-years to the destination star, and the speed of Jack's ship as a fraction of the speed of light. The function will return Jack's age and Jill's age at the time of Jack's return to earth, rounded to the nearest tenth of a year.  The math is simple enough for 10-year-old Jack to understand.
