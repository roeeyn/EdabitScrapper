All of the desks will be arranged in two columns, where desk #1 is at the top left, desk #2 at the top right, desk #3 is below #1, desk #4 is below #2, etc.\\n\\nYour program should return the number of ways two students can be seated next to each other. This means one student is on the left and one on the right, or one student is directly above or below the other student.\\n\\nTo illustrate:\\n\\n```\\n[[12, 2, 6, 7, 11]]\\n```\\n\\nThis classroom will look like the following:\\n\\n#### Column 1\\n```\\n[[#, 4, #, 8, 10, 12]]\\n// The first # is 2 and second # is 6 which are occupied.\\n```\\n\\n#### Column 2\\n\\n```\\n[[1, 3, 5, #, 9, #]]\\n// The first # is 7 and and second # is 11 which are occupied.\\n```\\n\\nBased on the above arrangement of occupied desks, there are a total of six ways to seat two new students next to each other.
