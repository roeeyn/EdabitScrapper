The following is an example of a (modified) Baconian ciphertext:\\n\\n```\\nciphertext = \\\"KNowlEDgE ITsElf Is power.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThe peculiar capitalisation might, at first glance, suggest that either the lowercase or uppercase letters contain, or code for, the hidden message (upper = \\\"KNEDEITEI\\\", lower = \\\"owlgslfspower\\\").\\n\\nBut actually, the Baconian cipher is a *steganographic* method of hiding information. The hidden message is not in the content of the ciphertext, but rather in the *presentation*. It doesn't matter which letters are capitalised, just the order of the capitalisation.\\n\\nTo decipher the ciphertext above, remove spaces and punctuation, then cleave the message into chunks of length 5, leaving out the remainder:\\n\\n```\\nciphertext = \\\"KNowl EDgEI TsElf Ispow\\\"\\n```\\n\\nEach chunk represents a letter. Decipher them according to the following table (\\\"u\\\" means uppercase, \\\"l\\\" means lowercase):\\n\\nLetter|Pattern\\n---|---\\na|uuuuu\\nb|uuuul\\nc|uuulu\\nd|uuull\\ne|uuluu\\nf|uulul\\ng|uullu\\nh|uulll\\ni|uluuu\\nj|uluul\\nk|ululu\\nl|ulull\\nm|ulluu\\nn|ullul\\no|ulllu\\np|ullll\\nq|luuuu\\nr|luuul\\ns|luulu\\nt|luull\\nu|luluu\\nv|lulul\\nw|lullu\\nx|lulll\\ny|lluuu\\nz|lluul\\n.|llllu\\n|  |lllll\\n\\n```\\ndeciphered = \\\"help\\\"\\n```\\n\\nCreate a function that takes 1 or 2 arguments:\\n\\n1.  A Baconian ciphertext or a plaintext message to be enciphered: `msg`.\\n2.  A background text in which the message is to be hidden: `mask`.\\n\\nIf only one argument is given (ciphertext), return the deciphered message (in lowercase, with spaces and full stops as encoded).\\n\\nIf a second argument is given, encipher the first argument `msg` into the `mask`, and return the resulting ciphertext. When enciphering, encipher full stops and spaces along with the words. Disregard the rest.
