Near the Earth, the rocket's trajectory will appear parabolic, but it will still be gravitationally bound to the second body and will enter an elliptical orbit around that body, with an orbital speed similar to the first body.\\n\\nTo escape the gravity of the second body once it has escaped the first body the rocket will need to be travelling at the escape velocity for the second body (ve2) (at the orbital distance of the first body). However, when the rocket escapes the first body it will still have the same orbital speed around the second body that the first body has. So its excess velocity as it escapes the first body will need to be the difference between the orbital velocity and the escape velocity. With a circular orbit, escape velocity is √2 times the orbital speed.\\n\\n### Objective\\nCreate a function that takes a planet as an argument and returns the escape velocity from the system Planet/Sun expressed in km/s, as well as the ratio between the calculated escape velocity from the system Planet/Sun and the escape velocity from the system Earth/Sun.\\n\\n### Data\\nIn the following table you will find for each planet its escape velocity relative to its own gravity and the escape velocity relative to the the Sun's gravity (at the corresponding orbital distance of the planet).\\n\\nPlanet | ve1 | ve2\\n--- | --- | ---\\nMercury | 4.25 | 67.7\\nVenus | 10.36 | 49.5\\nEarth | 11.186 | 42.1\\nMars | 5.03 | 34.1\\nJupiter | 60.20 | 18.5\\nSaturn | 36.09 | 13.6\\nUranus | 21.38 | 9.6\\nNeptune | 23.56 | 7.7\\n\\nConsider:\\n\\n```\\nk = 0.2929\\n```\\n\\n### Examples\\n```\\nsystem_escape_velocity(\\\"Mercury\\\") ➞ \\\"The escape velocity from the system Mercury/Sun is 20.3 km/s.
