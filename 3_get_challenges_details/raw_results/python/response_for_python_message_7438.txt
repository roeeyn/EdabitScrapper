For example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example #1). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example #4). If the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.\\n\\nConsider the following five hands dealt to two players:\\n\\n**Hand**|**Player 1**|**Player 2**|**Winner**\\n---|---|---|---\\n 1 |5H 5C 6S 7S KD|2C 3S 8S 8D TD| Player 2\\n 2|5D 8C 9S JS AC|2C 5C 7D 8S QH|Player 1\\n 3|2D 9C AS AH AC|3D 6D 7D TD QD|Player 2\\n 4|4D 6S 9H QH QC|3D 6D 7H QD QS|Player 1\\n 5| 2H 2D 4C 4D 4S| 3C 3D 3S 9S 9D|Player 1\\n\\nCreate a function which takes list of random hands dealt to two players. Each string contains ten cards (separated by a single space). The first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. The function should return the number of hands Player 1 won.\\n\\n### Examples\\n```\\nplayer1_wins([\\n  \\\"8C TS KC 9H 4S 7D 2S 5D 3S AC\\\",\\n  \\\"5C AD 5D AC 9C 7C 5H 8D TD KS\\\",\\n  \\\"3H 7H 6S KC JS QH TD JC 2D 8S\\\",\\n  \\\"TH 8H 5C QS TC 9H 4D JC KS JS\\\",\\n  \\\"7C 5H KC QH JD AS KH 4C AD 4S\\\"\\n]) ➞ 2\\n\\nplayer1_wins([\\n  \\\"5H QS 8S 6D 3C 8C JD AS 7H 7D\\\",\\n  \\\"6H TD 9D AS JH 6C QC 9S KD JC\\\",\\n  \\\"AH 8S QS 4D TH AC TS 3C 3D 5C\\\",\\n  \\\"5S 4D JS 3D 8H 6C TS 3S AD 8C\\\",\\n  \\\"6D 7C 5D 5H 3S 5C JC 2H 5S 3D\\\",\\n  \\\"5H 6H 2S KS 3D 5D JD 7H JS 8H\\\",\\n  \\\"KH 4H AS JS QS QC TC 6D 7C KS\\\",\\n  \\\"3D QS TS 2H JS 4D AS 9S JC KD\\\",\\n  \\\"QD 5H 4D 5D KH 7H 3D JS KD 4H\\\"\\n]) ➞ 3\\n\\nplayer1_wins([\\n  \\\"5S 9C KH KD 9H 5C TS 3D 7D 2D\\\",\\n  \\\"5H AS TC 4D 8C 2C TS 9D 3H 8D\\\"\\n]) ➞ 2\\n```\\n\\n### Notes\\n- Assume all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards).\\n- Each player's hand is in no specific order.\\n- In each hand there is a clear winner.\\n- Ten is given as **T** instead of 10.\",\"isFree\":false,\"isHidden\":false,\"lab\":\"Test.assert_equals(player1_wins([\\\"8C TS KC 9H 4S 7D 2S 5D 3S AC\\\",\\n\\\"5C AD 5D AC 9C 7C 5H 8D TD KS\\\",\\n\\\"3H 7H 6S KC JS QH TD JC 2D 8S\\\",\\n\\\"TH 8H 5C QS TC 9H 4D JC KS JS\\\",\\n\\\"7C 5H KC QH JD AS KH 4C AD 4S\\\"]), 2)\\nTest.assert_equals(player1_wins([\\\"5H QS 8S 6D 3C 8C JD AS 7H 7D\\\",\\n\\\"6H TD 9D AS JH 6C QC 9S KD JC\\\",\\n\\\"AH 8S QS 4D TH AC TS 3C 3D 5C\\\",\\n\\\"5S 4D JS 3D 8H 6C TS 3S AD 8C\\\",\\n\\\"6D 7C 5D 5H 3S 5C JC 2H 5S 3D\\\",\\n\\\"5H 6H 2S KS 3D 5D JD 7H JS 8H\\\",\\n\\\"KH 4H AS JS QS QC TC 6D 7C KS\\\",\\n\\\"3D QS TS 2H JS 4D AS 9S JC KD\\\",\\n\\\"QD 5H 4D 5D KH 7H 3D JS KD 4H\\\"]), 3)\\nTest.assert_equals(player1_wins([\\\"5S 9C KH KD 9H 5C TS 3D 7D 2D\\\",\\n\\\"5H AS TC 4D 8C 2C TS 9D 3H 8D\\\"]) , 2)\\nTest.assert_equals(player1_wins([\\\"5H QS 8S 6D 3C 8C JD AS 7H 7D\\\",\\n\\\"6H TD 9D AS JH 6C QC 9S KD JC\\\",\\n\\\"AH 8S QS 4D TH AC TS 3C 3D 5C\\\",\\n\\\"5S 4D JS 3D 8H 6C TS 3S AD 8C\\\",\\n\\\"6D 7C 5D 5H 3S 5C JC 2H 5S 3D\\\",\\n\\\"5H 6H 2S KS 3D 5D JD 7H JS 8H\\\",\\n\\\"KH 4H AS JS QS QC TC 6D 7C KS\\\",\\n\\\"3D QS TS 2H JS 4D AS 9S JC KD\\\",\\n\\\"QD 5H 4D 5D KH 7H 3D JS KD 4H\\\",\\n\\\"8C TS KC 9H 4S 7D 2S 5D 3S AC\\\",\\n\\\"5C AD 5D AC 9C 7C 5H 8D TD KS\\\",\\n\\\"3H 7H 6S KC JS QH TD JC 2D 8S\\\",\\n\\\"TH 8H 5C QS TC 9H 4D JC KS JS\\\",\\n\\\"7C 5H KC QH JD AS KH 4C AD 4S\\\"]), 5)\\nTest.assert_equals(player1_wins([\\\"KD 2S 3C 7C 4S QH TS AD 8C 2S\\\"]), 0)\\nTest.assert_equals(player1_wins([\\\"QH 8D 3C KC 4C 4H 6D AD 9H 9D\\\",\\n\\\"3S KS QS 7H KH 7D 5H 5D JD AD\\\",\\n\\\"2H 2C 6H TH TC 7D 8D 4H 8C AS\\\",\\n\\\"4S 2H AC QC 3S 6D TH 4D 4C KH\\\",\\n\\\"QD TD KD AD JD 3C 6D 2D 9H 6C\\\"]), 3)\",\"language\":\"python3\",\"stats\":{\"completed\":{\"ratings\":[4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,2,5,4,5,5,4,5,5,4],\"rators\":[\"RZjX2thqMwBdMeWZ6\",\"k5mp7Hkg8w5rwiXpe\",\"s5M5RvgqR9BhB9JoC\",\"aEm3Wvj2rFYRL8Lrb\",\"8PwfYqoDQFThzNtvf\",\"fznzd3qnvtbFkkizz\",\"xn7uGNKeAwPEkP9oA\",\"J3upzLHuEwXH7Z2hx\",\"yjtdwc2AC4jA2RWtn\",\"iS5BrkGLzJyPK7nKt\",\"gJYuGdkXEWWmGRLzu\",\"hP3dY9tJ9yC6ZoKtH\"],\"total\":14,\"quality\":[]},\"flags\":0},\"summary\":\"In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:\\n\\nS.No.|Hand Rank|Explanation\\n---|---|---\\n1|High Card| Highest value card.\\n2|One Pair| Two cards of the same value.\\n3|Two Pairs|Two different pairs.\\n4|Three of a Kind| Three cards of the same value.\\n5|Straight| All cards are consecutive values.\\n6|\",\"tags\":[\"arrays\",\"games\",\"logic\"],\"timestamp\":{\"$date\":1590552014519},\"title\":\"Poker Hands\",\"quality\":0,\"family\":[{\"_id\":\"rrzfvgZysom6yERdf\",\"language\":\"python3\"}]}}"]
