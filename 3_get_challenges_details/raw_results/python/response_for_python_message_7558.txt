The process revolves around picking two prime numbers, `p` and `q`, which are used to calculate public and private keys. The public key is used to encrypt a message, but is useless at decryption.\\n\\nYour task is to create two functions:\\n\\n### Encryption\\n\\n```\\nRSA_encrypt(txt, n, k) ➞ ctxt\\n```\\n\\n`txt` is the plaintext to be encrypted. The two numbers `n` and `k` are the **public key**.  `ctxt` is the ciphertext.\\n\\nSince the algorithm only works for numbers, `txt` is actually a number formed by concatenating the ASCII values of the uppercase letters in the message. For example, `\\\"cab\\\"` would be represented as `676566` (`ord(\\\"C\\\")==67`). During decryption, the process would be reversed in order to retrieve the letters.\\n\\n### Decryption\\n\\n```\\nRSA_decrypt(ctxt, p, q) ➞ txt\\n```\\n\\n`ctxt` is the ciphertext (actually a number). `p`, `q` are the aforementioned primes.\\n\\nThe Resource that I have chosen, \\\"The RSA Algorithm Explained Using Simple Pencil and Paper Method\\\", should give you enough information to make these two functions.\\nYou will find that when you determine the value of `k`, several choices are available.  For the purpose of this challenge, you are to pick the smallest possible value of `k`, as was done in the Resource.\\n\\n### Examples\\n```\\nRSA_encrypt(\\\"bad\\\",891877236769,5) ➞ 493825093669\\nRSA_decrypt(493825093669,900007,990967) ➞ \\\"BAD\\\"\\n\\nRSA_encrypt(\\\"bad boy\\\",5664239440446477941, 7) ➞ 605656648845318147\\nRSA_decrypt(605656648845318147,3255706151,1739788291) ➞ \\\"BAD BOY\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Notes\\n- You may find that determining the value of the private key, `j`, is difficult when `p` and `q` are large. Mathematically speaking, `j` is the **modular inverse of k(mod z)**.  \\n- See the added **Resources**.\",\"isFree\":false,\"isHidden\":false,\"lab\":\"Test.assert_equals(RSA_encrypt(\\\"a\\\", 31313, 7), 8037)\\nTest.assert_equals(RSA_decrypt(8037, 173, 181), \\\"A\\\")\\n\\nTest.assert_equals(RSA_encrypt(\\\"bad\\\", 891877236769, 5), 493825093669)\\nTest.assert_equals(RSA_decrypt(493825093669, 900007, 990967), \\\"BAD\\\")\\n\\nTest.assert_equals(RSA_encrypt(\\\"bad boy\\\", 5664239440446477941,  7), 605656648845318147)\\nTest.assert_equals(RSA_decrypt(605656648845318147, 3255706151, 1739788291), \\\"BAD BOY\\\")\\n\\nTest.assert_equals(RSA_encrypt(\\\"The walls have ears\\\", 901968578881865096604401774794258157339470998415824428329, 5), 213558654196086874712600284265576607076346122238380187931)\\nTest.assert_equals(RSA_decrypt(213558654196086874712600284265576607076346122238380187931, 36397637320634481157899636463, 24780965064743989300134401383), \\\"THE WALLS HAVE EARS\\\")\",\"language\":\"python3\",\"stats\":{\"completed\":{\"ratings\":[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5],\"rators\":[\"aCNWav8S8Try9RkC6\",\"aEm3Wvj2rFYRL8Lrb\",\"8PwfYqoDQFThzNtvf\",\"Z4M3NAa4TXquMNkHe\",\"s5M5RvgqR9BhB9JoC\",\"yjtdwc2AC4jA2RWtn\",\"iS5BrkGLzJyPK7nKt\"],\"total\":8,\"quality\":[]},\"flags\":0},\"summary\":\"RSA cryptography is a method by which two parties can securely share information without having to exchange any \\\"secret codes\\\" that would allow an attacker to compromise security.
