The air around the brick is a constant 25 degrees. A perpendicular section through the center of the brick is a `10x10` array showing the temperature at each of 100 points.\\n\\nLet's specify that we can determine the temperature change of any point in the array by averaging its temperature with the temperatures of its 8 contiguous points (vertically, horizontally and diagonally). If the point is on the edge or the corner of the array then some of those 8 points will be at the ambient 25 degrees.\\n\\nGiven that at time `t=0`, the bottom of the brick is at 90 degrees and the rest of the brick is at the ambient 25 degrees, devise a function that will calculate the array of temperatures at a later time `t` in minutes. You will recalculate the temperatures at one minute intervals. Round them to the nearest degree.\\n\\n### Examples\\n```\\nhot_brick(0) ➞ [\\n  [25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25]\\n  [25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25]\\n  [25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25,
