One of its challenges required contestants to come up with an expression (using some randomly generated numbers) to meet or get as close as possible to a chosen target number.\\n\\nThis challenge is a simplified version of that. Write a function that takes in a tuple of unique positive integers and a target positive integer and returns a string containing an expression that combines the numbers in the tuple so that they meet the target, subject to certain rules explained in the notes below.\\n\\n### Examples\\n```\\ncountdown((1, 2), 3) ➞ \\\"1+2\\\"\\n\\ncountdown((2, 3, 5, 75), 158) ➞ \\\"3+5+2*75\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Notes\\n- The tuple of operands consists of a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5 unique positive integers presented in ascending order. An acceptable answer must use each operand once only, combining to meet the target.\\n- The operators to use are the standard Python arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*` and `//`. Normal operator precedence rules apply. Do not use parentheses.\\n- Each puzzle has at least one answer which meets the above criteria. In the tests, a checker function checks that the expression returned evaluates to the target and that the rules on operands and operators are met.\",\"isFree\":false,\"isHidden\":false,\"lab\":\"import re\\n\\ndef checker(answer, operands, target):\\n    '''\\n    Returns target if answer evaluates to it within the rules, otherwise\\n    'Failed'\\n    '''\\n    OPERATORS = {'+','-', '*', '//'}\\n    \\n    try:\\n        ans = eval(answer)\\n        assert ans == target, 'Expression does not match target'\\n        expr = answer.replace(' ','')\\n        nums = re.split('[^\\\\d]', expr)\\n        assert sorted(int(num) for num in nums if num.isnumeric()) == \\\\\\n               sorted(operands), 'Must use each operand once'\\n        ops = re.split('\\\\d+', expr)\\n        assert all(op in OPERATORS for op in ops if op != ''), \\\\\\n              'Must only use designated operators'\\n\\n        return ans\\n    except AssertionError as e:\\n        print(e)\\n        return 'Failed'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\noperands = (\\n            (4,9,50,100),(1,2),(1,2,3,4,5),(1,10,20),(4,20,75,100),\\n            (4,7,9,20),(3,5,7,15,100),(2,3,5,75),(3,12),(3,4,5)\\n           )\\n\\ntargets = (554,3,7,2,345,208,687,158,4,23)\\n\\nfor i, nums in enumerate(operands):\\n    Test.assert_equals(checker(countdown(nums,targets[i]),nums,targets[i]),targets[i])\",\"language\":\"python3\",\"stats\":{\"completed\":{\"ratings\":[3,3,3,3,3,4,5,4,5,5,4,5,2,1,0,5,5],\"quality\":[],\"rators\":[\"aEm3Wvj2rFYRL8Lrb\",\"GgLd4eWBu79mdjtkP\",\"DPi9QGLctq2y76KuE\",\"J23RcmzbdtBbPCTjT\",\"iS5BrkGLzJyPK7nKt\",\"Afnps7TJQuS9sipMb\",\"eHcgvkTGsH7ZziqBo\",\"yjtdwc2AC4jA2RWtn\",\"8sNv5PTHa7XQ8bNqR\",\"cFpQafr595xz2z9dC\",\"2PufnQcsHsfymufX3\",\"gJYuGdkXEWWmGRLzu\"],\"total\":25},\"flags\":0},\"summary\":\"Many British visitors to edabit will be familiar with Countdown, a quiz program that ran for many years on UK television.
